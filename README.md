# WEWUT
Examples from Working Effectively With Unit Tests by Jay Fields

Tests as first presented in the book is in the `wewut.original` package, final state in the `wewut.refactored` package.

Note: I took the liberty of changing linebreaks throughout, as the examples in the book were heavily compressed to
fit on narrow lines. Aside from that and replacing a tab with a space in `wewut.original.CustomerTest::rentalInfo()`
that caused tests to fail, the tests are exactly as presented in the book.
